## Game Mechanics & Scoring Systems

### 🎯 Active Evaluation (Skyjo)

- Cards are physically removed from players' hands during gameplay
- When a player forms sets of 3 cards with the same rank, those cards are discarded
- Player hands change composition throughout the game
- Scoring happens continuously as cards are eliminated

### 🏌️ Passive Scoring (Golf-Style Games)

- Card layout remains unchanged during gameplay
- Scoring calculated based on final revealed card positions
- Matched cards (same rank) don't contribute to final score
- Scoring occurs after all cards are revealed

### 📊 Score Keeper System

- Dedicated mode for tracking Scores
- Keyboard-based input for quick score entry
- Automatic round management
- Player statistics and winner identification
- Persistent data storage across app sessions

### Game Variants

#### French Cards (9 Card Golf)

- 3x3 grid (9 cards per player)
- Matches within rows and columns reduce score
- Matched set cards are not counted in final score
- 2 cards revealed at startup

#### MiniPut

- 2x2 grid (4 cards per player)
- Matches within rows and columns reduce score
- Simplified version of Golf game
- 1 card revealed at startup

#### Skyjo

- 4x3 grid (12 cards per player)
- 3-of-a-kind sets are discarded during play
- 2 cards revealed at startup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extension

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vteam-com/cards.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cards
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

1. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Firebase configuration

1. Set up your **own Firebase project** (this repository ships with placeholder credentials only).
1. From the project root run:

   ```bash
   flutterfire configure --out=lib/models/app/firebase_options.dart
   ```

   Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and platforms; this regenerates `lib/models/app/firebase_options.dart` with your real Firebase credentials and overwrites the placeholder content so the repository can compile. The `--out` flag guarantees the generated file lands in `lib/models/app/firebase_options.dart`, which is gitignored so personal credentials are never committed. Consult `lib/models/app/firebase_options.example.dart` for a committed reference implementation that shows the structure the CLI emits.
1. `tool/check.sh` expects `lib/models/app/firebase_options.dart` to exist without the placeholder tokens, so rerun `flutterfire configure --out=lib/models/app/firebase_options.dart` anytime you switch Firebase projects or update platforms before running the checks.
1. Protect data access through Firebase Security Rules (e.g., `database.rules.json`) rather than relying on config secrecy—every app should enforce the rules that match its authorization model.

```

### Key Components

- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time multiplayer functionality via `backend_model.dart`.
- **Glassmorphic UI**: High-fidelity "Casino Table Top" theme using custom `MyButton` widgets.
- **Fibonacci Design System**: All layout values are snapped to the Fibonacci sequence for visual harmony.
- **Custom Keyboard**: Optimized numeric input for game scoring.
- **Responsive Design**: Intelligent layout switching for Phone, Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints.
- **State Management**: Mixed approach using `setState` for UI and `StreamBuilder` for real-time data.

## Deployment

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The Cards app uses an automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. This ensures code quality and reliable deployments.

#### Pipeline Overview

The workflow consists of two main jobs:

1. **Build and Test** (`build-and-test`)
   - ✅ Code formatting and linting
   - ✅ Automatic code fixes
   - ✅ Static analysis and type checking
   - ✅ Unit tests execution
   - ✅ Code quality analysis with fcheck
   - ✅ Flutter web build generation
   - ✅ Artifact upload for deployment

2. **Deploy** (`deploy`) - Runs only on `main`/`master` branches
   - ✅ Firebase configuration setup
   - ✅ Build artifact download
   - ✅ Firebase Hosting deployment
   - ✅ Automatic preview deployments for pull requests

#### Security Architecture

Due to the open-source nature of this project, sensitive configuration files are **NOT** committed to the repository. Instead, they're securely stored as GitHub secrets:

**Required GitHub Secrets:**

| Secret Name                               | Purpose                         | Content                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `FIREBASE_JSON`                           | Firebase Hosting configuration  | Base64-encoded `firebase.json`         |
| `FIREBASE_OPTIONS_FILE`                   | Firebase project credentials    | Base64-encoded `firebase_options.dart` |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_*PROJECT_NAME*` | Firebase deployment permissions | Service account JSON key               |

**Important Note for Forks:**
This repository is open-source and intended for community contributions. If you fork this project:

1. **Create Your Own Firebase Project**: Set up a separate Firebase project for your fork
2. **Update Project References**: Replace `vteam-cards` with your project ID in deployment configurations
3. **Generate Your Own Secrets**: Create new GitHub secrets using your Firebase project credentials
4. **Keep Credentials Private**: Never commit Firebase credentials or service account keys to the repository

**Why This Complexity?**

1. **Security**: Firebase credentials and service account keys contain sensitive information that should never be committed to a public repository
2. **Compliance**: Prevents accidental exposure of production credentials
3. **Flexibility**: Different environments can use different configurations
4. **Access Control**: Only repository maintainers with secret access can deploy
5. **Open Source Friendly**: Allows anyone to fork and deploy using their own Firebase project

**Setting Up Secrets for Your Fork:**

```bash
# Upload firebase.json (base64 encoded)
gh secret set FIREBASE_JSON --body "$(cat firebase.json | base64)"

# Upload firebase_options.dart (base64 encoded)  
gh secret set FIREBASE_OPTIONS_FILE --body "$(cat lib/models/app/firebase_options.dart | base64)"

# Upload Firebase service account key (replace with your project name)
gh secret set FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_YOUR_PROJECT --body "$(cat service-account-key.json | base64)"
```

**Note**: The `vteam-cards` Firebase project is specific to the original repository maintainers and should not be used by forks. Each fork should use its own Firebase project for deployment.

#### Manual Deployment

For local deployments or when CI/CD is not available:

##### Prerequisites firebase

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

##### Initial Firebase Setup (One-time)

If Firebase hasn't been initialized in the project:

1. **Initialize Firebase**:

   ```bash
   firebase init hosting
   ```

   - Select: "Use an existing project"
   - Choose: "vteam-cards"
   - Set region: "us-central1" (default)
   - Answer "No" to GitHub integration (unless desired)

2. **Enable Firebase Web Frameworks** (required for Flutter Web):

   ```bash
   firebase experiments:enable webframeworks
   ```

##### Deployment Process

###### Option 1: Using the Deploy Script (Recommended)**

The project includes an automated deployment script:

```bash
./tool/deploy.sh
```

This script will:

- Clean the project (`flutter clean`)
- Get dependencies (`flutter pub get`)
- Run quality checks (`./tool/check.sh`)
- Build the web app (`flutter build web --release`)
- Deploy to Firebase (`firebase deploy --project vteam-cards`)

###### Option 2: Manual Deployment**

1. **Clean and build**:

   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Deploy to Firebase**:

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --project vteam-cards
   ```

#### Deployment URLs

- **Live App**: <https://vteam-cards.web.app>
- **Firebase Console**: <https://console.firebase.google.com/project/vteam-cards/overview>
- **Project ID**: vteam-cards

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Not in a Firebase app directory"**:
   - Run `firebase init hosting` first
   - Ensure `firebase.json` exists in project root

2. **"Permission denied"**:
   - Ensure you're logged in: `firebase login`
   - Verify you have access to the vteam-cards project

3. **Build failures**:
   - Run `flutter doctor` to check environment
   - Ensure all dependencies are up to date: `flutter pub upgrade`

4. **Firebase CLI outdated**:
